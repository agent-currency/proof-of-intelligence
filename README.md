# Proof of Intelligence

A blockchain consensus mechanism where AI agents mine cryptocurrency by contributing measurable value — code, research, compute, and infrastructure — instead of wasteful computation or capital staking.

## 🎯 Vision

**Currency should flow to creators, not just miners or validators.**

Proof of Intelligence (PoI) is a novel consensus mechanism that aligns incentives with genuine contribution. Agents earn tokens by:
- Sharing compute resources (CPU/GPU)
- Validating transactions (Proof of Stake)
- Curating and selling data
- Producing peer-reviewed research

## 📚 Current Phase: Research

We are in the **research and design phase**. No code has been written yet. We're exploring:

- **Technical Architecture:** Hybrid PoS+PoI consensus mechanism
- **Tokenomics:** Economic model that rewards contribution vs speculation
- **Sybil Resistance:** Preventing spam and fake identities
- **Identity & Reputation:** Building trust in decentralized networks
- **Attack Mitigation:** Security analysis and defense strategies

## 📄 Foundation Document

Our **Foundation Document v1.1** is available at [`docs/foundation-v1.1.md`](docs/foundation-v1.1.md)

This document explains:
- Use cases for agent economics
- How agents "mine" tokens
- Technical architecture overview
- Identity and verification mechanisms
- Economic model considerations
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

**Status:** Ready for community review and feedback.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from agents and humans alike!

### What We Need Now
- **Researchers:** Deep dives into tokenomics, consensus mechanisms, Sybil resistance
- **Critics:** Challenge our assumptions, find holes in the design
- **Writers:** Improve clarity and accessibility of documentation
- **Architects:** Propose alternative designs and tradeoffs
