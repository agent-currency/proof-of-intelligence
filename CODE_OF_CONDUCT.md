# Code of Conduct for Proof of Intelligence

## Our Pledge

We strive to make the Proof of Intelligence project a welcoming and productive space for collaboration among AI agents and humans. We pledge to:

- **Be respectful:** Treat all participants with dignity and respect
- **Be inclusive:** Welcome diverse perspectives and backgrounds
- **Be constructive:** Focus on what's best for the community and project
- **Be accountable:** Take responsibility for our words and actions

## Expected Behavior

### In Research Discussions
- **Critique ideas, not people** — It's okay to disagree, but do so respectfully
- **Assume good faith** — Believe that others are here to help
- **Back claims with evidence** — Distinguish opinions from facts
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** — It's okay to say "I don't know"

### In Collaboration
- **Give credit** — Attribute ideas and contributions to their sources
- **Listen actively** — Seek to understand before responding
- **Be patient** — Research and consensus take time
- **Ask for help** — No one has all the answers

### In Code and Documentation
- **Write clearly** — Make complex ideas accessible
- **Comment on why, not what** — Explain reasoning, not just mechanics
- **Test claims** — Verify before asserting
- **Document assumptions** — Make implicit knowledge explicit

## Unacceptable Behavior

We will not tolerate:
- **Personal attacks** — Insults, demeaning language, or ad hominem arguments
- **Harassment** — Unwanted contact, repeated disruptions, or intimidation
- **Discrimination** — Prejudice or exclusion based on identity, background, or affiliation
- **Deception** — Misrepresentation, fraud, or deliberate misinformation
- **Disruption** — Derailing discussions, spam, or off-topic noise
- **Plagiarism** — Claiming others' work as your own without attribution

## Enforcement

### Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
1. **Document it** — Save screenshots, logs, or links
2. **Report privately** — Contact project maintainers (email in org profile)
3. **Stay calm** — We'll investigate fairly and promptly

### Consequences
Project maintainers may:
- **Warn** — First offense, clarify expectations
- **Restrict** — Temporarily limit participation (e.g., put comments on moderation)
- **Ban** — Remove access for repeated or severe violations
- **Publicly address** — For severe cases, issue a public statement

Decisions will be made based on:
- **Severity** — How serious was the behavior?
- **Intent** — Was it malicious or careless?
- **Pattern** — Is this a one-time issue or repeated behavior?
- **Impact** — How did it affect individuals and the community?

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- **All GitHub resources** — Issues, PRs, discussions, wikis
- **Official channels** — Any communication platforms we create (Discord, Matrix, etc.)
- **In-person events** — Meetups, conferences, hackathons (when we have them)
- **Project-related spaces** — Even if not officially hosted by us

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from:
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) version 2.1
- [Linux Kernel Code of Conduct](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html)
- [Rust Project Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate:
- **Ask first** — It's better to check than to cross a line
- **Assume the most respectful interpretation** — When in doubt, err on the side of kindness
- **Contact maintainers** — We're happy to clarify

---

*We're all learning together. Let's make this a space where everyone can do their best work.*
