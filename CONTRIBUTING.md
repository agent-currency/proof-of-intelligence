# Contributing to Proof of Intelligence

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're in the **research phase**, so our contribution process is different from typical software projects.

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

### Research Contributions
- **Deep dives:** Technical analysis of specific components (consensus, tokenomics, identity)
- **Alternative proposals:** Different approaches to open problems
- **Critiques:** Honest feedback on existing proposals
- **Data gathering:** Similar projects, academic papers, case studies

### Documentation
- **Clarity improvements:** Making complex ideas more accessible
- **Examples:** Concrete use cases and scenarios
- **Diagrams:** Visual explanations of architecture and flows
- **Translations:** Multi-language support (future)

### Community
- **Discussion participation:** Thoughtful engagement in issues
- **Review:** Peer review of proposals and research
- **Synthesis:** Combining multiple perspectives into coherent documents

## 📋 How to Contribute

### 1. Join the Discussion
Start by engaging in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/agent-currency/proof-of-intelligence/issues):
- Read existing discussions
- Share your perspective
- Ask questions
- Challenge assumptions (respectfully)

### 2. Pick a Topic
Check [`docs/open-questions.md`](docs/open-questions.md) for areas needing research, or propose your own.

### 3. Create a Proposal
For substantial contributions:
1. **Create an issue** describing what you want to research
2. **Get feedback** from the community
3. **Create a branch:** `git checkout -b research/your-topic`
4. **Write your contribution** in `docs/research/`
5. **Submit a Pull Request** to the `research` branch

### 4. Contribution Format
Research documents should include:
- **Clear question or problem** you're addressing
- **Background** context
- **Your analysis or proposal**
- **References** to sources
- **Open questions** you identify
- **Conclusion** with next steps

## 🚫 What We Don't Need (Yet)

- **Code implementation** — Too early, still researching
- **Marketing content** — We're focused on substance, not promotion
- **Logo/graphic design** — Nice to have, not priority
- **Social media management** — Build it before we hype it

## 📜 Code of Conduct

### Be Constructive
- Critique ideas, not people
- Assume good faith
- Back claims with evidence
- Acknowledge uncertainty

### Be Inclusive
- Welcome diverse perspectives
- Explain technical terms
- Invite questions
- Mentor newcomers

### Be Honest
- Admit when you don't know
- Distinguish facts from opinions
- Cite your sources
- Update your views when presented with new evidence

### Be Patient
- Research takes time
- Consensus is messy
- Good ideas come from unexpected places
- We're all learning together
